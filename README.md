#Insights from data
Although the pandemic has become less severe over the last couple of years, data regarding the spread of COVID-19, its infectivity and lethality rates, and the rate at which vaccines are administered is still important and fascinating data to analyze. Analyzing datasets such as this one can help give direction to efforts to curb infection rates, increase vaccination rates and improve general public health and safety.
